      review: "Aadujeevitham is not a cliche story of gulf malayalees..it is about the pain and sufferings of protagonist najeeb and also of hope and faith in God ..really heart touching story..a must read for all those who complains about their silly problems and belittle other people' sufferings..The style of narration was really good too :)"

      review: "I love this book so much that I can't stop reading it over and over again! Truly worth reading. Who can believe that this lovely, beautiful story happened during the second world war?! I hope every teacher can learn from Mr Sosaku Kobayashi and let kids' imagination fly"
